==== version 0.9.9 (2014-09-21) ====

* ipu, vpu, v4l2src: Use reference counting for resources
  This ensures that resources are freed only after when every entity
  that uses them has been shut down

  ipu: use a global FD and increase/decrease refcount for each blitter
       instance and for every (de)allocation

  vpu: increment/decrement refcount not only when creating/shutting down
       decoder instances, but also for every (de)allocation

  v4l2src: instead of using a raw FD, use a reference-counted FD object

* ipu: use a global FD instead of per-blitter FDs
  this circumvents bugs in the IPU kernel driver which are triggered
  when multiple IPU FDs are open at the same time

* introduce a proper physical address type and a printf conversion specifier

* remove cpu address from GstImxPhysMemory and add an "internal" pointer
  as an optional, internal, allocator-specific extra parameter
  (for example, a handle to an internal DMA buffer object)

* rplace obsolete "padding" member in phys mem meta with better defined
  x_padding/y_padding ones
  this avoids having to do calculations like "padding / stride" to get to
  the number of additional rows, for example

* use a reference counter for mapping physical memory
  necessary because the same physical memory might get mapped multiple times
  (commonly done by gst_video_frame_map() and multi-planar formats like I420)
  until now, it was mapped the first time, and subsequent mapping calls were
  just ignored, but a reference counter is much cleaner and safer

* ipu: fix kernel version detection and include paths in wscript
  now, the <3.5.0 kernel version check works properly

* eglvivsink: remove RGB from the list of supported formats
  Vivante direct textures support various RGBA/RGBx formats, but not RGB

* Miscelleanous:
  * Logging improvements
  * Added notes to functions that return floating references
  * Removed obsolete todo file
